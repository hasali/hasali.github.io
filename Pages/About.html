		<p>
			I'm a Front-end Developer based in Toronto, Canada. I have a passionate goal to produce high quality responsive websites and web apps.

			I studied Software Development at Sheridan College where I built a foundation for my skills in programming. After which, I spent time learning different front-end frameworks, namely React and Angular while also focusing on Node.js for back-end. Most of this was self-taught.

			As a side hobby, I do enjoy making small games. Either with a small engine made with the help of SFML or something in Unity as it is very beginner friendly.
